# JBrowse Loader
In an effort to make JBrowse more accessible to more scientists, this JBrowse loader creates a UI to upload fasta files
straight into JBrowse using PyQt5.

It also will allow users to upload unassembled data and use SPAdes to assemble the data, then upload the assembled contigs straight into JBrowse.
